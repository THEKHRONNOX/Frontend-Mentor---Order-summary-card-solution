## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements **note: And practically they should***

## My process **Haha...**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tears
- Pain
- And Sorrow

### What I learned

Nothing. Besides that `img` and `background-image` are a very fucked up kind of hell.

### Continued development

I plan to continue this thing later, and very tired of CSS right now, and don't how much more I could handle being "developing" this crap
